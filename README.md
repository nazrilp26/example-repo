# Cafe Stock Management System

This project is a simple Python program that allows a user to create a café menu, capture stock quantities and prices for each menu item, and calculate the total value of stock held.

The program ensures a minimum number of menu items, stores data using lists and dictionaries, and outputs both individual item stock values and the overall stock value for the café.
